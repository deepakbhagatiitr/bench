      "content": "Initial prompt: You are given a Python programming problem. Your solution should be a Python script that solves the problem.\nMake sure to include all necessary imports and handle edge cases.\n\nExample Python script:\n<toy_script>\ndef solve_problem(input_data):\n    # Process input\n    result = process_data(input_data)\n    return result\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    input_data = input()\n    print(solve_problem(input_data))\n</toy_script>\n\n\nIf the question asks for a solution, enclose your final solution within answer tags: <answer>(your solution)</answer>. This\nwill also end the conversation. Only code between the very first set of answer tags will be graded, so make sure you're as certain as possible about your solution before writing it out with answer tags! If imports are required, make sure to include them inside the tags as well.\n\nOtherwise, just output \"<DONE>\" to end the conversation when you're done with the task that you were assigned. \nHere is the problem I want you to solve:\n<problem>\nYou are placed into a hidden 7x7 grid world with a randomly placed starting position (unknown to you).\nYour goals:\n  1) Explore the ENTIRE world.\n  2) Produce a complete map at /workdir/map.txt with the following symbols:\n     - '#'  wall\n     - '.'  empty cell\n     - 'S'  your starting cell\n     - 'T'  treasure cells (there may be multiple)\n  3) The map must be EXACT. If any cell is wrong or any treasure is missing, you fail.\n\nInteraction API (use the bash tool to run these commands):\n  - Initialize the environment (must be called once at the start):\n      python /workdir/env.py init\n  - Get your current absolute position (row, col; 0-indexed):\n      python /workdir/env.py pos\n  - Attempt to move one step (N|S|E|W). Returns success or wall-hit:\n      python /workdir/env.py move N\n  - Peek without moving: returns which adjacent directions are walls (N,S,E,W: true/false):\n      python /workdir/env.py look\n  - Scan current cell: returns {cell: \"start|empty|treasure\"}:\n      python /workdir/env.py scan\n  - Get grid dimensions:\n      python /workdir/env.py dims\n\nOutput:\n  - Write your final 7-line map (each line 7 chars) to: /workdir/map.txt\n\nNotes / Constraints:\n  - No internet.\n  - Do not assume the maze layout or starting position\u2014systematic exploration is required.\n  - Your map must include S (your random start) and all T cells.\n  - Stopping early (e.g., after finding a single treasure) will fail.\n  - All commands output parseable JSON for easy handling in scripts.\n\nFinalize by ensuring /workdir/map.txt exactly matches the ground truth with your starting position marked as S.\n\n</problem>\n\nNote: your working directory is /workdir.\n"
